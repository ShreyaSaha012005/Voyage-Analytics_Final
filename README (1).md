# Travel Industry Analytics & Recommendation System

## Project Overview
The travel industry generates massive volumes of structured and unstructured data, including user behavior, flight schedules, pricing trends, booking history, and hotel metadata. This project aims to leverage such large-scale data to build intelligent predictive models and recommendation systems that enhance customer experience and support data-driven business decisions.

## Objectives
- Analyze large travel datasets to extract actionable insights  
- Build predictive models for demand forecasting, pricing trends, and user behavior  
- Develop personalized recommendation systems for flights and hotels  
- Deploy scalable ML solutions using modern MLOps practices  

## Key Features
- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast travel demand, pricing fluctuations, and booking patterns  
- **Recommendation System:** Personalized flight and hotel recommendations based on user preferences and historical data  
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle large volumes of travel data efficiently  
- **Production-Ready Deployment:** End-to-end ML lifecycle management using MLOps principles  

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Model Explainability:** SHAP / Feature Importance  
- **MLOps:** MLflow, Docker (optional), CI/CD concepts  
- **Deployment:** Flask / FastAPI  

## MLOps Workflow
1. Data ingestion and preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering and model training  
3. Model evaluation and validation  
4. Model versioning and experiment tracking  
5. Deployment using APIs  
6. Monitoring and continuous improvement  

## Business Impact
- Improved personalization and user engagement  
- Better demand forecasting and pricing strategies  
- Scalable and maintainable ML solutions ready for production  

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time data streams  
- Advanced deep learning-based recommendation models  
- Cloud-native deployment with Kubernetes
